## Structure

Each day's challenge is placed in its own directory:

```
AoC2023/
â”œâ”€â”€ 1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ input.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ 2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ input.txt
â”œâ”€â”€ 3/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ main.go
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ input.txt
```

- `main.go`: Contains the solution for that day.
- `input.txt`: Contains the input data provided by Advent of Code for the challenge.

## Running the Solutions

To run the solution for a specific day, navigate to the day's directory and run the Go file. For example:

```bash
cd AoC2023/1
go run main.go
```
